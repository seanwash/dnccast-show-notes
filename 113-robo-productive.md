Payroll and benefits are hard, especially for small businesses. You certainly don’t have the time to be an expert in things like taxes and regulations. That's where [Gusto](https://gusto.com/spec.fm) comes in – [Gusto](https://gusto.com/spec.fm) is making payroll, benefits, and HR easy for small businesses!

They're hiring! They’re solving hard engineering problems as they evolve our architecture to meet mutating regulatory requirements in the US and beyond. They obsess over intuitive UX, and this requires hidden complexity in software design. Gusto engineers own features end-to-end, including building APIs in Rails to UX in React. Help them engineer a world where payroll, HR, and benefits are easy for small businesses. If this sounds up your alley, you can learn more at [https://gusto.com/spec.fm](https://gusto.com/spec.fm).
