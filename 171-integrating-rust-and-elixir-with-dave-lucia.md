Relying on customers to report errors is not good. It's rude to customers and bad for business.

Ideally, this would be solved easily with tests. Why not just cover every scenario with a test? Then life would be perfect and fine and great. Because here in reality, humans are pretty bad at writing tests. Not just because we’re all kinda lazy and maybe a little dumb, but also because we can’t anticipate every single way users are going to interact with our product. They might do something really, really, really stupid (or something really, really, really smart) that we didn’t think about.

That’s why [Sentry](https://www.sentry.io) tells you about errors in your code before your customers have a chance to encounter them.

Not only do we tell you about them, we also give you all the details you’ll need to be able to fix them. You’ll see exactly how many users have been impacted by a bug, the stack trace, the commit that the error was released as part of, the engineer who wrote the line of code that is currently busted, and a lot more.

Your code is broken. Let’s fix it together. [Sentry.io](https://www.sentry.io).

## Dave Lucia

> I’ve been writing Elixir since the Fall of 2016 where I was the first developer reporting to the CTO at The Outline [theoutline.com](http://theoutline.com/). We built a news website in Elixir/Phoenix with a custom CMS from the ground up, and part of that journey was working with Dockyard / Chris McCord.
>
> We were supporting a few million users a month with just 2 Heroku dynos. We only needed 1, the other was for backup. I was there for two years, now I’m at [simplebet.io](http://simplebet.io/) where I’m Platform Architect. Here we’re using Elixir + Rust to build realtime betting products.
