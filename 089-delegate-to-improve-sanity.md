In episode 89 of Does Not Compute, Sean and Paul talk about trusting Stripe and Shopify to know what's best when it comes to payment forms and checkout, saving your time and sanity by delegating ops work to Heroku, and how making decisions because of a scale you don't yet have "but might someday" isn't a good idea.
