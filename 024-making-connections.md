### Listener Questions

> What should people do to prepare for getting a new job? - @mcmahonial

* Be honest on your resume, keep things short and sweet.
* Paul's resume breaks almost every rule where he doesn't use a cover letter, doesn't use a lot of buzzwords
* Use tools like hired or job boards to see what's out there - do your research!
* As best you can, pick and choose who you apply to for work - Vet your future employers!
* Check in with employees of a company that you might want to work for - Look for signs of burnout or stress.
* Check out conferences and meetups if you can - they're a great way to meet people and make connections in the industry (connections <=> jobs).
