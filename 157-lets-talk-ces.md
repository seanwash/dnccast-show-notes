Guys we have an absolutely amazing offer for you today!

Something that is super interesting about CES is that they moved from a .ORG address to CES.TECH.
 Having seen that further validates how well a .TECH Domain fits for an entity that has TECH at its core whether it’s the biggest consumer TECH Show in the world or a passionate techie like yourself.
We highly recommend securing your very own .TECH Domain. Brands such as Viacom and Intel have moved to a .TECH Domain. Even start-ups with over 500 Million in funding, many of which were at CES are on a .TECH Domain.
 
Make most of the .TECH CES SALE and Go to [go.tech/CESLive](https://go.tech/CESLive) and use code CESLIVE for a huge 90% off on 1, 5 and 10 year .TECH Domain for a limited time only and secure yours now!

Relying on customers to report errors is not good. It's rude to customers and bad for business.

Ideally, this would be solved easily with tests. Why not just cover every scenario with a test? Then life would be perfect and fine and great. Because here in reality, humans are pretty bad at writing tests. Not just because we’re all kinda lazy and maybe a little dumb, but also because we can’t anticipate every single way users are going to interact with our product. They might do something really, really, really stupid (or something really, really, really smart) that we didn’t think about.

That’s why [Sentry](https://www.sentry.io) tells you about errors in your code before your customers have a chance to encounter them.

Not only do we tell you about them, we also give you all the details you’ll need to be able to fix them. You’ll see exactly how many users have been impacted by a bug, the stack trace, the commit that the error was released as part of, the engineer who wrote the line of code that is currently busted, and a lot more.

Your code is broken. Let’s fix it together. [Sentry.io](https://www.sentry.io).
